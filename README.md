## 🌿 About Me  
 
Who believes that AI can (and should) make life simpler, not harder?  
Who occasionally celebrates when a pipeline finally runs without errors? 🙋‍♀️  

Hi, that’s me — Jeevana.  
I enjoy building things that make machines understand us better.  
Right now, I’m working with **Golang backend systems** and learning how **AI pipelines** fit together end to end.  
Mostly curious, sometimes experimental, always trying to make something work just a little better.

## ⚙️ What I’m Doing  

- 💻 Working as an **SDE Intern at ConverseNow AI**  
- 🧩 Learning **Go**, **Python**, and the art of making systems talk to each other  
- 🐳 Playing around with **Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and backend automation**  
- 📘 Reading up on **agentic and passive AI systems** to understand how they evolve

## ☕ Outside of Work  

When I’m not staring at logs or training models,  
you’ll find me learning something random, sketching ideas, or just fixing that one line of code that refuses to work.
