### About Me

Who’s the one fixing containers when everyone else has logged off?  
Who believes good systems are built one small improvement at a time?  
That would be me — Jeevana.

I like building things that make technology feel simple and useful.  
Right now, I’m learning how AI pipelines, backend systems, and automation tie everything together.  
Mostly curious, often experimenting, and always learning something new.
